NebulaTech, a tech industry conglomerate with various satellite companies, sought a cohesive and versatile icon set to strengthen their brand identity and improve user experience across their subsidiaries. The challenge involved creating a unified visual language catering to the unique needs of each company operating in different sectors.

I conducted research on each subsidiary to understand their core values, audiences, and products. After analyzing their existing design systems, I identified common patterns and themes to serve as the foundation for the new icon set. I sketched concepts, iterated on client feedback, and refined the designs for optimal legibility, scalability, and consistency.

The final icon set comprised carefully crafted, pixel-perfect icons that were aesthetically appealing and functional. These versatile icons seamlessly adapted to various use cases, screen sizes, and contexts, making them suitable for use across NebulaTech's diverse range of companies. The new cohesive icon set enhanced user experience and contributed to reinforcing NebulaTech's brand recognition in the competitive tech landscape.
